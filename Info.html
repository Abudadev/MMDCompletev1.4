    <h2>Discoveries</h2>
    <p>Marie Maynard has made one of the most important discoveries like the relationship between high cholesterol and hypertension back in Marie's time they fed rats high cholesterol diet's and observed that their arteries got clogged which led to death because no blood would go to the heart and the heart pumped faster and faster so the cholestrol that is clogging the arteries could break and blood could go to the heart but at the end the heart would not be able to do so and that caused heart attack.
     Later when she graduated she teamed up with another person called Alfred Mirsky together they both studied about DNA. Later Marie found out how histones work and what they do which made understanding DNA way easier.
